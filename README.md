                           C++ RPG Character Management System 🎮⚔️

A comprehensive Object-Oriented Programming project that simulates a role-playing game (RPG) character management system. 
Built during my third semester as part of my OOP course to demonstrate advanced C++ concepts including templates, inheritance, polymorphism, and memory management.

🎯 What This Project Does

This system lets you create and manage RPG characters (like in video games), organize them into teams and guilds, 
and simulate epic battles between characters. Think of it as the backend system that could power a game like World of Warcraft or Final Fantasy.

Key Features

Create Different Character Types: Warriors (Barbarians), Archers, and Rogues
Flexible Health Systems: Normal health, super health (takes half damage), or infinite health
Special Abilities: Berserk mode, fireball attacks, and healing powers
Weapon System: Swords, axes, bows, crossbows, daggers, and bare hands
Team Management: Group characters into teams for adventures
Guild System: Characters in guilds get health bonuses
Battle Simulation: Characters can fight each other with realistic damage calculations

🏗️ Technical Architecture

Core Design Patterns Used
Template Programming: Characters can have different health types and abilities
Inheritance Hierarchy: Base Character class with specialized subclasses
Polymorphism: Different character types behave uniquely in battles
RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization): Proper memory management
Rule of Five: Complete implementation of copy/move constructors and operators
